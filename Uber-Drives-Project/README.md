Questions to ask the dataset :-
1. What is the total number of cab rides for each category (business/personal)?
2. What is the total number of round trips for each month?
3. What is the average fare for each month?
4. Is there a noticeable trend in the number of cab rides per month?
5. What are the top 5 cities with the highest number of cab rides?
6. What is the distribution of miles and time taken for cab rides?
7. What is the average time taken for airport rides compared to non-airport rides?
8. What is the busiest hour and highest pickup point?
9. What is day of the week with most and least TripCount ?
10.  Where do the majority of trips occur between ?


Conclusions drawn :-
Asking the above questions can help in reaching the following conclusions:
1. Business cabs were used more in volume and traveled more distance than personal cabs.
2. December had the highest number of round trips compared to other months.
3. December had a high demand for cabs, making it a good month to raise fares and earn more profit.
4. There is a seasonal pattern in cab rides, with December having the highest demand.
5. Cab traffic is high in just a few cities compared to others.
6. Most of the cab rides are within a distance of 35 miles and take about 30 minutes.
7. Cab rides to and from airports take more time compared to non-airport rides.
8. The busiest hour is 1 PM to 4 PM and the highest pick-up point location is Cary.
9. The day of the week with most TripCount is Friday, and the least is being Wednesday.
10. The majority of trips originate and end between Cary and Morrisville.


How these conclusions can be used to generate profit for Uber :-
1. They can Focus on promoting business cabs, as they are used more frequently and cover longer distances.
2. Offer special promotions, discounts, or incentives for round trips in December, when more users are likely to use the service.
3. Raise fares or implement surge pricing in December when demand is higher, thus maximizing revenue.
4. Offer seasonal promotions or incentives to encourage users to take more rides during specific periods.
5. Concentrate marketing and service expansion efforts in the top 5 cities with high cab traffic to capture a larger market share.
6. Optimize pricing and service offerings for rides within 35 miles and taking about 30 minutes, as these constitute a significant portion of the total rides.
7. Investigate and address any operational inefficiencies causing longer travel times for airport rides, as this could impact customer satisfaction and loyalty.
8. Uber needs to station or contract more drivers in Cary to reduce wait times, especially during 1pm - 4pm; thereby enhancing customer satisfaction.
9. With more available cars in high-traffic cities on Fridays, there will surely be positive customer satisfaction feedback.
10. For locations with minimal demand like Gampaha, Latta, and Briar Meadows, Uber can launch marketing initiatives such as mobile app ads or YouTube ads in those markets.
